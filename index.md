# About me
B. Parazin is a PhD Candidate at McGill University in the department of Earth and Planetary Sciences.
They model the interactions between ice sheets, the solid Earth, sea level rise and climate change. This is done through simulating the evolution of these systems using geophysical models.
At McGill University, they are a member of the Gomez Geodynamics Group, lead by Dr. Natalya Gomez, who is also their advisor. 
Through their research, they hope to better understand how Earth's climate has changed in the past, how those changes were influenced by the interactions between different parts of the Earth system, and what that can tell us about future climate change. 

Beyond research, B. is passionate about climate justice, societal equity, and giving back to the communities they are a part of. They have previously served on the mobilization and diversity committees of McGill's graduate student union, worked as a trail maintenance team member for the Trustees of Reservations, and they currently volunteer with the prisoner correspondence project.
